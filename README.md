# FOSS-Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the first session pertaining to Introduction to Free Software and it's in depth meaning, " Free as in Freedom " 


Free software means software that respects user’s freedom and community. The users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
Free software is a matter of liberty, not price.
We sometimes call it “Libre software” to show we do not mean it is gratis(without charge ).


Why should you use free software ? 

-> Distribute the copies of your modified work

-> Freedom to study the program

->Run the program as you wish 

-> The whole community benefits from the work you do !! 


Their are numerous open source communities worldwide.You grow by giving back to the community !
